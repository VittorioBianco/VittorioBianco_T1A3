# **5x5 Trainer Terminal Application**

## Install Guide

## **Features**

### Feature 1

The 5x5 Workout Terminal Application features a Menu system made by using the Ruby Gem TTY Prompt in a Loop.  It also contains if/else statements which correlate to the menu options, for example if the user chooses the first menu option depicted by a number one and the descriptor it will print a brief summary of the 5x5 workout regiment.

### Feature 2

The second feature the application has is it is able to read external text files and print their contents to the screen.  Variables are used to link a File.read function where the argument points to the assosciated text files and their directory.

### Feature 3

The third feature that the application has is the ability for users to log their workouts and view them.  When the user selects the menu option to log a workout they will see a printed message asking them which exercises they would like to log along with a short list of the applicable exercises in the 5x5 regiment.  The user types in their exercise which is taken with a variable "gets".  They then see another printed question asking them how many sets of the excercise they performed which again is recieved as a variable "gets" with to_i(nteger) type coercion.
Finally, the input is pushed to an empty array as a interpolated string along with a date.
This feature is wrapped side of a method / function.
