# Terminal App Idea

I am developing a health and fitness terminal application as my submission for the T1A3 assignment.  The main function of the application will be the workout logger; it will allow users to enter a workout and save it.  

The tracker allows users to keep a record of any progress a user has made and keep it stored in one place and it is primarily targetted towards other developers who are interested in keeping healthy and fit.  

The application itself should, after installation greet the user and bring them to a terminal menu and ask them to enter their name, if they are in the database it will then ask them to either enter their weight or view their history.  

When a user views their history the application will allow the user to delete an entry should they choose to if for example they have accidently entered an incorrect entry.

The fitness application will offer a beginners guide to a 5x5 workout routine - a great place to start in the gym for a full body workout and to start making gains.# VittorioBianco_T1A3
